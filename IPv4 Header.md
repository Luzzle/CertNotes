### Overview
- We are focusing on the Layer 3 header
- Minimum length of the IPv4 header is 20 bytes
- Maximum length is 60 bytes

### Fields
- Version
	- Length: 4 bits
	- Identifies the version of IP used.
	- Either IPv4 or IPv6
- IHL (Internet Header Length)
	- Length: 4 bits
	- Identifies the length of the header in 4 byte increments
	- If the value is 5 then 5 x 4 bytes = 20 bytes total length
- DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)
	- Length: 6 bits
	- Used for QoS (Quality of Service)
	- Prioritizes delay-sensitive data
- ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
	- Length: 2 bits
	- Provides end to end notifications of network congestion without dropping packets
- Total Length
	- Length: 16 bits
	- Indicates the total length of the packet (L3 header + L4 segment)
	- Measured in bytes (not in increments)
	- Minimum value is 20 (IPv4 header with no data)
	- Maximum value is 65535
- Identification
	- Length: 16 bits
	- If a packet is fragmented due to being larger than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) this field identifies which packet it belongs to.
- Flags
	- Length: 3 bits
	- Bit 0: reserved always 0
	- Bit 1: DF (Don't Fragment) indicates a packet should not be fragmented
	- Bit 2: MF (More Fragments) indicates there are more fragments in the packet
- Fragment Offset
	- Length: 13 bits
	- Indicates the position of the fragment within the original unfragmented packet
	- Allows the packet to be correctly reconstructed
- TTL
	- Length: 8 bits
	- Used to prevent infinite loops
	- In practice it indicates a hop count, the router decreases the TTL by 1
- Protocol
	- Length: 8 bits
	- Indicates the protocol of the encapsulated L4 segment
	- Value 6: TCP
	- Value 17: UDP
	- Value 1: ICMP
	- Value 89: OSPF
- Header Checksum
	- Length: 16 bits
	- Calculated checksum used to check for errors in the IPv4 header
- Source / Destination
	- Length: 32 bits each
	- IPv4 address of source and destination
- Options
	- Length: between 0 to 320 bits
	- Rarely used
