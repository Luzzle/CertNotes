### Overview
Starting with version 9.0 of VCF and VVF, licensing of your environment is handled by VCF operations and **VCF Business Services console (vcf.broadcom.com).**
Subscription-based license files replace the use of 25-character license keys.

The license that is automatically created in the VCF Business Services console after you purchase a subscription is called a **default license**.
The default license is a pool of capacity from all active subscriptions of the same product in the same Site ID.

### License Operations
You are able to split a default license into as many licenses as you need within your *total purchased capacity*. When you delete a split license, its capacity is added back into the capacity of the default license.

You can perform the following operations on the license file in the **VCF Business Services** console:
- Split licenses.
- Merge licenses.
- Delete licenses.
- Add capacity.
