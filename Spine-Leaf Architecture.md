### Overview
Hosts are connected to every Spine switch.
Every spine switch is connected to every leaf switch.
Switches do not connect to switches of the same type.

The path taken by traffic is randomly chosen to balance the traffic among the spine switches. Each server is separated by the same number of hops which provides consistent latency.
