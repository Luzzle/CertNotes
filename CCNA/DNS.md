### Overview
DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses.
Devices will save the DNS server responses to a local DNS cache. 

### Configuration
```ios
# ip dns server -> configure router to act as a DNS server
# ip host NAME IP -> configure list of hostname ip address mappings
# ip name-server IP -> configure a dns server that the router will query if the requested record isnt in its host table
# enable router to perform dns queries

# show hosts

```
