Transmits light over glass fibers
Transmit and receive are all on different cables and are opposite on each end.

### Structure
1: Fiberglass core that transmits light
2: Cladding that reflects light
3: Protective buffer
4: Outer Jacket

### Single-Mode Fiber
- Light enters at a single angle (mode) from a laser based transmitter
- Allows for longer distance than Multimode
### Multimode Fiber
- Core diameter is wider than single-mode fiber.
- Allows multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the core.
- Cheaper than single mode, cheaper LED-based SFP transmitters

### Fiber Optic Standards
- 802.3z - 1Gbps - Multi or Single (1000BASE-LX) - 550M (MM) 5KM (SM)
- 802.3ae - 10Gbps - Multimode (10GBASE-SR) - 400M
- 802.3ae - 10Gbps - Single (10GBASE-LR) - 10KM
- 802.3ae - 10Gbps - Single (10GBASE-ER) - 30KM
