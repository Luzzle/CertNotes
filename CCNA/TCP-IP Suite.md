| OSI Model | TCP/IP Suite |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 7,6,5     | 4            |
| 4         | 3            |
| 3         | 2            |
| 2, 1      | 1            |
### Notes
- Application layer provides process-to-process communication.
- Transport layer provides host-to-host communication.
