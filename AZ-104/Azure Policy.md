### Definition
- Azure Policy is a service that allows you to create, assign, and manage governance policies that enforce rules and effects over Azure resources to ensure that they stay compliant with your IT governance standards. 

- These policies enforce various rules and effects on resources, ensuring that they adhere to corporate standards and service-level agreements. These policies are described in JSON format and are known as policy definitions. 

- Azure Policy is crucial for enforcing organisational standards and assessing compliance on a large scale.

- Azure Policy operates in the control plane of [[Azure Resource Manager]]

#### ARM - Data Plane
The data plane is where the policies are enforced. This involves direct interaction with the data stored in the resource.

### Resources
#### Definitions
Azure Policy definitions describe resource compliance conditions and the effect to take if a condition is met. The definition location determines the scope to which the initiative or policy can be assigned.

**Built-in policy** is a type of policy definition that's generated by Azure Resource Providers and is available by default.
**Custom policy** is a type of policy definition that's written by a policy user when no built-in policy maps to your requirements.

#### Initiatives
Initiatives allow you to group several policy definitions to simplify assignments and management because you work with the initiatives as a single item.

The initiative definition contains all policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal, such as organisational compliance goals or compliance with regulatory frameworks.

#### Assignments
Policy assignments define which resources are evaluated by a policy definition or initiative. Policy assignments can be done in the portal, an API call, or through the command line interface.

#### Excemptions
Use the Policy exemptions feature to _exempt_ a resource hierarchy or an individual resource from evaluation of initiatives or definitions. Resources that are _exempt_ count toward overall compliance but can't be evaluated or have a temporary waiver. They're created as a child object on the resource hierarchy, or the individual resource granted the exemption.

#### Attestations
Policy attestations are used by Azure Policy to set compliance states of resources or scopes targeted by manual policies. Each applicable resource requires one attestation for each manual policy assignment.

#### Remediations
The policy remediation task feature is used to bring resources into compliance based on a definition and assignment. Resources that are noncompliant to a _modify_ or _deployIfNotExists_ definition assignment can be brought into compliance by using a remediation task.
