### Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling, also known as _scale up and scale down_, involves increasing or decreasing the virtual machine **size** in response to a workload. Vertical scaling makes a virtual machine more (scale up) or less (scale down) powerful.

- If you have a service built on a virtual machine that's under-utilized such as on the weekend, you can use vertical scaling to decrease the virtual machine size and reduce your monthly costs.
    
- You can implement vertical scaling to increase your virtual machine size to support larger demand without having to create extra virtual machines.

### Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling, also referred to as _scale out and scale in_, is used to adjust the **number** of virtual machines in your configuration to support the changing workload. When you implement horizontal scaling, there's an increase (scale out) or decrease (scale in) in the number of virtual machine instances.
