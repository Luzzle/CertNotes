### Definition
A network virtual appliance (NVA) is a virtual appliance that consists of various layers like:

- A firewall
- A WAN optimizer
- Application-delivery controllers
- Routers
- Load balancers
- IDS/IPS
- Proxies

Network virtual appliances (NVAs) are virtual machines that control the flow of network traffic by controlling routing. You'll typically use them to manage traffic flowing from a perimeter-network environment to other networks or subnets.
