Azure Management groups provide a level of scope about subscriptions. They allow you to easily manage access, policies and compliance for those subscriptions.

##### Subscriptions
Azure Subscriptions are a single unit of billing and scale. Allow you to locally organise resource groups and facilitate billing.

##### Resource Groups
Localised group of resources. When you apply an action to a RG, it applies to all resources in a group. A resource can only be in one RG at a time.
