### Overview
Most wireless networks aren't standalone and provide wireless access to a wired network infrastructure.

The upstream network is called the **DS (Distribution System)**.
*Each wireless BSS or ESS is mapped to a VLAN in the wired network*

Its possible for an AP to provide multiple wireless LANs, each with a unique SSID.
Each WLAN is mapped to a separate VLAN and is connected via a trunk.
