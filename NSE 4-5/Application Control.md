### Overview
Application Control identifies applications such as Google, Skype etc... and acts on that network traffic.

For each filter in the application control profile the following actions can be taken.

1. Allow: Passes the traffic.
2. Monitor: Passes the traffic and generates a log.
3. Block: Drops the detected traffic and generates a log message.
4. Quarantine: Blocks traffic from the suspected source until the expiration time is reached.

### Network Protocol Enforcement
NPE allows you to configure network services on known ports, while blocking those services on other ports.
