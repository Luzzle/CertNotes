#NSE4 

### Overview

This is similar to agent-based polling, but instead the FortiGate polls directly instead. As the name suggests, this does not require an external DC agent or collector agent.

More CPU and RAM is required by the FortiGate. This only supports WinSecLog.

Workstation verification is not available in agentless polling mode.
